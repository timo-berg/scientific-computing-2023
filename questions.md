## Pen & Paper

### Task 3
What is the stencil representation?

### Task 4
What to do here? (haven't really looked at it yet)

## Implementation

### Task 1
What theoretical prediction is meant here?

### Task 4
Solution converges but is not a good fit.

### Task 5
Julia can't compute an inverse for any combination of values of c/n that we tried.
