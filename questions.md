## Pen & Paper

### Task 3
What is the stencil representation?
- Same as the full stencil because its 1D
### Task 4
What to do here?
- As long as the stencils are related by a constant it should be good.

In general, give more context especially to easy questions.


## Implementation

### Task 1
What theoretical prediction is meant here? 
- O(h^2)

### Task 4
Solution converges but is not a good fit.


### Task 5
Julia can't compute an inverse for any combination of values of c/n that we tried.
